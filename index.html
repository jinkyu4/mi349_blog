      <p>Artificial intelligence has grown from an academic curiosity to a daily tool. From digital assistants to self-driving cars, AI shapes how we live, work, and play. Many people interact with AI without even realizing it—recommendation systems, voice recognition, and image filters are all powered by machine learning algorithms. 
      </p>
      <p>One of the most exciting trends is the integration of AI in healthcare. Systems now assist doctors in diagnosing diseases faster and with higher accuracy. AI is also helping improve agricultural yields and optimize supply chains. While concerns about job replacement are valid, AI also creates opportunities for new careers and industries. The key is adapting to this technological shift responsibly.</p>

      <h2>Why Hiking is Good for the Mind</h2>

      <p>Hiking has long been celebrated for its physical health benefits, but its positive effects on mental well-being are equally powerful. Spending time in nature reduces stress, improves focus, and boosts mood. Walking along trails disconnects us from the distractions of modern life and reconnects us with the rhythms of the natural world.</p>
      <p>Studies show that even a short hike can lower cortisol levels and improve sleep quality. The combination of physical activity, fresh air, and natural beauty creates a restorative experience for both body and mind. Hiking with friends also strengthens social bonds and provides meaningful shared experiences. Whether it’s a mountain trek or a simple walk in a nearby park, hiking is a powerful antidote to stress.</p>

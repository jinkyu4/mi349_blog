        Growing up watching basketball with my dad, we always liked to debate on who the best player of all time is. Since my dad grew up in Chicago in the 1900's, he use to see Michael Jordan play at the peak of his career and what people might think is the peak of NBA basketball. But now in 2025, a whole bunch of new players have entered the league including what some people might consider the best player of all time, Lebron James. My dad and I would always debate on who was better Jordan or Lebron due to the fact that Jordan was the best player during his adolesense and Lebron being the best during mine. So who really is the G.O.A.T. is it Jordan or Lebron. Lebron has played for over 20 years in the nba and has achieved many things since then. Lebron has won 4 championships on 3 different teams with finals MVPs in every one of them. He also has 4 MVPs and has made the All Star game every year. Jordan has 6 rings with 5 MVPs and 6 Finals MVPS. There are many arguments to both side with the biggest being that Jordan has more rings. But there is stilla lot more we have to consider. For example, Lebron has been the longest tenured NBA player of all time and currently holds the record for most points in a career. Some will also say that Jordan has had better teams built around him with better coaches. But on the other side, Jordan is 6/6 in NBA finals whilw Lebron has lost 6. So who do you guys think the GOAT is?

        Today I woke up at 8 am and got ready to go to class. I quickly ate a sandwich and drove 10 minutes to my class where I learned Assembly code. After I went straight to work but before I picked up some Chipotle to eat at work. At work I filed some documents and went to a meeting from 1 PM to 6 PM. After I went to watch my friends IM Volleyball game. We then played football for an hour and now I am working on this assignment to finish tonight. I plan to watch the football games before I head to bed. Tommorow I plan to study all day for an exam I have Friday but otherwise today was a very fun day with a lot of enjoyment and productivity.
